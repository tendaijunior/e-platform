This course delves into the principles and application of health and safety management within the workplace. It draws from occupational psychology, industrial engineering, and legal frameworks such as the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA). Students explore the nature of hazards (chemical, physical, ergonomic), risk assessment matrices, and the design of mitigation strategies. Literature includes studies on risk perception in high-risk industries and comparative analysis of international safety systems (e.g., OHSAS 18001 vs ISO 45001).
